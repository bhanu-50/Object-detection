**ðŸ§  YOLOv8 Object Detection API (FastAPI)**

        This project demonstrates a simple object detection pipeline using YOLOv8 and FastAPI.
        It allows you to upload an image through an API endpoint (/detect) and returns:
        
        Detected object classes
        
        Confidence scores
        
        Bounding box coordinates
        
        Path of the saved output image (with bounding boxes drawn)
